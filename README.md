# Sensor
Code that will taken input from a sensor, decode the input data, store the data in an excel/csv file, and plot the data in real time.
Uses matlibplot's built-in function FuncAnimation to handle the real time plotting

**Problem is data received is too fast as FuncAnimation cannot keep up with the plot
